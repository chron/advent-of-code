# Advent of Code submissions

My submissions for the Advent of Code challenge.  Details here:

https://adventofcode.com

All submissions are in Ruby.

* The `2018` / `2019` folders have the versions of the code exactly as I submitted them â€” written as fast as possible with no thought to code style or performance at all.
* The `2018-golf` folder has golfed versions of some of the challenges from that year.  I didn't get very far with the golfing.
